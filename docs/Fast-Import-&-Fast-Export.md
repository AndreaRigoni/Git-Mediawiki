The format of data exchanged between mediawiki is the fast-import / fast-export format of git.

Both directions - import and export - use the [mediawiki API](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page). 
Scripts are written in Perl mainly because mediawiki's API in perl was a fit to our needs and we already had at our disposal a perl script to help us.

## Mediawiki -> Git

The goal here is to fetch data from the mediawiki using the API and then, format them in fast-import. Our code was based on a script snippet created by Jeff King [Link to discussion](http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/167560)

Here is the flow-chart of this part

## Git -> Mediawiki

This part is for the most part an edit query of the mediawiki API. Because again, a flow chart is worth a thousand words, here is the flow chart for this part

The conflict verification part is explained in the [[Further developing]] page
