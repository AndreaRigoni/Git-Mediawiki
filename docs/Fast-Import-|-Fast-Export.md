The format of data exchanged between mediawiki is the fast-import / fast-export format of git.

Both directions of the gate also make use of the mediawiki API [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page]. The scripts are written in Perl.

## Mediawiki -> Git

The goal here is to fetch data from mediawiki using the API and format them in fast-import. We based our code on a script snipped created by Jeff King [Link needed]

## Git -> Mediawiki

Fully supported by the mediawiki api ? [More info needed]
