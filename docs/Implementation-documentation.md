The use of remote helpers is the most important choice of our implementation as our project has to be as transparent as possible to the git user. Import and export are realized mostly with git's fast import and fast export functionalities.

   * [Remote helpers](Remote-Helpers.md)
   * [Fast Import & Fast Export](Fast-Import-&-Fast-Export.md)

We need to store metadata, using git notes

   * [Git notes](Git-notes.md)

A tricky part : data encoding

   * [Data-encoding](Data-encoding.md)
