Welcome to the Git-Mediawiki project wiki.

## What is Git-Mediawiki ?

Git-Mediawiki is a project which aims to creating a gate between git and mediawiki, allowing git users to push objects to and pull objects from mediawiki just as one would do with a classic git repository.

## But, don't other solutions already exist ?

Github and ikiwiki propose solutions for git-based wikis. Our project wants to be transparent to wiki users and transplantable on any wiki without having to change anything server-side. A simple git clone on a mediawiki would initialize a repository on your side and you would be able to interact with the wiki without bothering classic users.

## Who are we ?

We are four students from [ENSIMAG](http://www.ensimag.fr), an IT engineering school based in France. This project is part of our end-year project for our second year of studies in this school. This project is mentored by [Matthieu Moy](http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~moy/?lang=en) and [Sylvain Boulme](http://www-verimag.imag.fr/~boulme/), and developed with the help of the [git community](http://git.kernel.org/).
