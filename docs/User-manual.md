## Getting started with Git-Mediawiki

To start, the first operation you should do is cloning the remote mediawiki. To do so, run the command

`git clone mediawiki::http://yourwikiadress.com`

From now on, you can use your traditional pull, push, add, commit... and your favorite IDE to work on your wiki pages
